# ML_Project47-MarketingCampaignResultPrediction

### Marketing Campaign Result Prediction Project
This repository contains the code and instructions for a project that predicts the results of marketing campaigns based on customer data.

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will respond positively to a marketing campaign. This information can be invaluable for businesses to optimize their marketing efforts and maximize return on investment.

### Project Components

Data: The project utilizes the marketing_campaign.csv dataset containing customer information and their responses to marketing campaigns.

Code: The main.py file includes the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Models: The project implements three machine learning models: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

Evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy score on a testing set.

### Installation

### To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
```
numpy
pandas
sklearn
matplotlib (optional for visualization)
```

### You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

### File Descriptions

marketing_campaign.csv: The dataset containing customer data and marketing campaign responses.

main.py: The main script for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

README.md: This file (you're currently reading it!).

### Instructions
Clone this repository:
```
https://github.com/Thireshsidda/ML_Project47-MarketingCampaignResultPrediction.git
```
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.


### Results
The script will print the accuracy scores of each model on the testing set. You can compare these scores to determine the best performing model for predicting marketing campaign results.
